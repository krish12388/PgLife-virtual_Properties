      <h3>PG at a click</h3>
      <h1>The PG Locator website is designed to help users find paying guest (PG) accommodations with ease. It provides detailed information about PG options, including location, facilities, food availability, pricing, transportation access, and safety measures. <br> The platform aims to simplify the search process by offering a centralized repository of PG-related data, allowing users to make informed decisions based on their preferences and budget.</h1>

      <h3>Key features</h3>
      <h1>A PG Finder website allows users to search and filter accommodations based on location, price, and amenities. It offers detailed listings with photos, descriptions, reviews, and virtual tours. Tenants can book directly, save preferences, and communicate with property owners through in-app messaging. The site supports secure payments, interactive maps, multi-language browsing, and provides dashboards for tenants and owners. Notifications, a rating system, and 24/7 customer support ensure a seamless experience, while a companion mobile app adds on-the-go accessibility. <br>
         It’s a comprehensive solution for finding quality PG accommodations conveniently.</h1>

      <h3>Wide  connectivity for better experience</h3>
      <h1> Monthly rent for accommodations,  may range from ₹5,000 to ₹15,000. The distance of PGs from major landmarks or public transport hubs (e.g., 500 meters from a metro station or 2 km from the city center) is often crucial. The capacity of each PG, such as single, double, or triple sharing rooms, can be included, along with ratings and reviews—averaging 4.2/5 stars based on 200+ user reviews. Additional data such as advance deposit requirements (e.g., ₹10,000 refundable security), availability of amenities like Wi-Fi (speed up to 100 Mbps), laundry (₹500 per month), and meal packages (₹2,000–₹4,000 monthly) can also be specified to assist users. This type of numerical detail ensures transparency and convenience for prospective tenants.</h1>
