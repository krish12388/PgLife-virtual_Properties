PgLife-virtual_Properties

An animation-based front-end project demonstrating interactive virtual property visuals.

Overview
- This project is animation-focused and uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create dynamic visual effects for virtual properties.

Files
- `main.html` — Main demo page (entry point).
- `srcipt.js` — JavaScript for animations and interactions.
- `style.css` — Styles and CSS animations.

How to run
- Open `main.html` in a web browser (double-click or use a local static server).
- To serve locally (recommended for consistent behavior):

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/main.html
```

Notes
- The project is intentionally animation-driven; tweak `style.css` and `srcipt.js` to adjust timings, effects, and interactivity.
